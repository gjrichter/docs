**Data-Krauti** is a free tool for exploring tabular data. It is based on **HTML5** and operates directly in your browser without any additional installation. It can load both local and remote files in the formats **CSV, JSON, GeoJSON**, and **TopoJSON**. You can **analyze** and filter **the** data using several tools. If the data contains **geographic information**, a **map** can be activated to explore the data in its geographic context and relevance.

# What Can I Do with Data-Krauti?

You can load and view data in table formats like CSV, JSON, GeoJson and TopoJson and

- get a quick view on the table structure
- see the first 100 rows of the data sort by table view by columns
- filter the table data by column values (regular expression are possible)
- generate data facets; one facet per column to understand the data and apply filters 
- get a quick data analysis with data type, min/max/sum or unique values and missing values   
- generate pivot tables
- see the data on a map if geographic information is present in the data

**Intended usage:**
Quick view and explore local and online data with a focus on data with geographic information. Create a basic iXMaps visualization from the data.

Works well for small and medium size data (approximate < 500 000 rows).

# What Is It Not?

Data-Krauti is:

- not a data editor
- not a dashboard
- not a notebook
- no database query
