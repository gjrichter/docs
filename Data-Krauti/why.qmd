# Why Data-Krauti ?

**Data-Krauti** is for exploring data without having to install anything. It is inspired by mapshaper.org which gives everyone a tool to view and manipulate geographic data (.shp, geojson, topojson) n the browser.

**Data-Krauti**  is also basic configuration tool for **iXMaps** visualization projects if the analyzed data holds geographic information. If you made a map with the data loaded, you can generate a HTML page with the JavaScript code to create the same map directly from data using the iXmaps embed API.
