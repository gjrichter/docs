# Getting started

**Data-Krauti** is a free tool to explore tabular data. It is based on **HTML5** and lives inside your browser without any other installation. It can load as well local as remote files in the formats **CSV, JSON, GeoJson** and **TopoJson**. You can **analyse** and filter **the** data with several tools. If the data contains **geographic information**, a **map** can be activated to explore the data in its geographic extension and relevance.

# loading data

At the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to:

  - Identify the main features that make Julia an attractive language for Data Science
  - Set up a Julia environment to run their data analysis
  - Efficiently handle datasets (even across different languages) through Tables.jl and Arrow.jl
  - Fit (generalized) linear mixed models with MixedModels.jl
  - Communicate across languages (Julia, R, python)

Intended audience and level:
The tutorial is intended for any data scientist with experience in R and/or python who is interested in learning the attractive features of Julia for Data Science. No knowledge of Julia is required.
