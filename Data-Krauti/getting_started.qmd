# Getting Started

**Data-Krauti** is a free tool for exploring tabular data. It is based on **HTML5** and operates directly in your browser without any additional installation. It can load both local and remote files using the data loading form you see below.

![](.\pics\getting-started-1a.png)

# Load Data

**Data-Krauti** can load both local and remote files in the formats **CSV, JSON, GeoJson**, and **TopoJson**.

It automatically detects the file type, and for CSV files, it also detects the separator.

For JSON files, **Data-Krauti** will look for the first array of JSON objects and parse it into a table.

> #### Multiple Data
>
> **Data-Krauti** allows you to load and view as many datasets as you want. Each loaded dataset will have its own table view and tools. You can delete data from the view as well.

# Table View

If the data loads successfully, you will see the data in a table view.

> **Note:** **Data-Krauti** displays only the first 100 rows of data.

You can use the column labels in the first row to sort the table by the values of that column.

# Explore the Data

Above the table view, you'll find a button bar to activate various actions for analyzing the data.

| Action       | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Facets**   | Shows the aggregated values of each column in a sidebar and supports filtering.              |
| **Analyze**  | Displays an analysis of each column, above the column values.                                |
| **Filter**   | Displays input areas above the columns to define filters; regular expressions are possible.  |
| **Process**  | Creates pivot tables.                                                                         |
| **Map**      | Displays the table values on a map if geographic information is present in one or two columns. |

# Facets

**Facets** are the primary tool for exploring a data table. They display an aggregated visualization of the values in each column in a suitable format.

- **Numeric** values are visualized as distribution **histograms**.
- **Textual** values may be **categorical** (few unique values) or **descriptive** and other text.

> **Every facet** can be used to **filter the data**.
>
> Below the histograms, you will find a range slider, but you can also click on the bars to select a value range.
>
> Facets of columns with few unique values (categorical) will show the unique values with a counter. You can click on a value to filter by that category.

# Analyze

The **Analyze** feature uses a similar process to analyze the data but displays a summary of the results in the first row of the table. It also changes the background color of the columns to highlight the data type.

# Filter

The **Filter** feature displays an input field at the top of each column to define a column value filter.

- the defined filter may be a **regular expression**
- you can filter numeric values by > and < operators; example '> 1000'

# Process

Process offers tools to create a derivative table. Actually you can create a **pivot table** from the loaded data. The tool opens a sidebar where you must select the columns to be used to create the pivot table.

![](.\pics\pivot.png)

Every column of the original table can have a special role that you can select by the dropdown at the right. For a pivot table please select a least one column into the 'row' role.

| Role  | Description                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **row**   | The column whose (unique) values will define the rows of the pivot table.    |
| **columns** | The column whose (unique) values will define the columns of the pivot table. |
| **values** | The column where the values to be aggregated by row and column are found.   |
| **keep**  | The column(s) to copy from the original table.                              |

A special 'role' is 'keep'. Values of this column(s) are copied to the pivot table. If the 'keep' column has different values for the same 'row' selector, the last value is copied.

In the upper example we copied the X and Y columns so we put the pivot table on a map.



# Map

**Data-Krauti** uses **iXMaps** to display the data on a map. By default you get a visualization with blue dots if positions are found in the data or blue lines shapes if the data contains GeoJSON or TopoJSON line or polygon elements.

Data-Krauti tries to find geographic information in the data. If it cannot find appropriate data, an empty map is displayed. You can then try to define the geographic columns manually with the tool 'config. map'.

![](.\pics\map.png)

With the tool 'config.map' you can customize the visualization.

## Now you can make the map yours!

At any time Data-Krauti can generate a HTML code with embedded iXMaps and a configuration to produce the map you have configured by the button '**show embedding code (HTML)**'

> You cannot create a functioning HTML map if you loaded local data.
> But you can fix the data URL later in the HTML code
